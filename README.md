# Web Development Curriculum
This is a curriculum I created (though it is ever evolving) to help others learn web development.
I have used this curriculum at CUNY Queens College to teach a summer web development course.
Please feel free to use or contribute to this curriculum.
The curriculum can be viewed [here](https://aryanj-nyc.gitbooks.io/webdev-curriculum/content/).

# About Me
I'm just a guy looking to help others learn how to build websites.
I host regular meetups in Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens.
Please visit my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aryanjabbari) and [GitHub](https://github.com/AryanJ-NYC) pages.
I'd love to hear what you think!
