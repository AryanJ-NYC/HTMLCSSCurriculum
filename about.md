**Who are you?** I'm just a guy looking to help others learn how write some code. I hope to hold regular Meetups in Queens.

**Queens meetups?** Yup! Join our [Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/free.code.camp.queens.ny/) to make sure you don't miss any.

**Can I really learn to code?** Of course you can! And you can do it for free. There are TONS of resources online that I hope to share with you.
However, you do need to put work in. Please don't expect to be able to make entire websites in a few months while not working at it every day.
