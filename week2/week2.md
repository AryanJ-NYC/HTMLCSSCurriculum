# Bootstrap
Resource: [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) - Bootstrap is a CSS/JavaScript (we'll learn JavaScript later) *framework* (pre-written code/instructions, in our case, pre-wrritten CSS).  Basically, Twitter (who created Bootstrap) created a *framework* that makes developing ***mobile-first*** web applications easier.
