# Bootstrap
Resource: [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) - Bootstrap is a CSS/JavaScript (we'll learn JavaScript later) *framework* (pre-written code/instructions, in our case, pre-wrritten CSS).  Basically, Twitter (who created Bootstrap) created a *framework* that makes developing ***mobile-first*** web applications easier.

View the BootStrap CSS file [here](assets/css/boostrap.css).

## Let's Build
[CodePen](http://codepen.io/) - Go to CSS settings (the gear) | Quick-add: Bootstrap  
[Thimble](https://thimble.mozilla.org) - make sure to add `<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.5/css/bootstrap.min.css">` to the HTML `<head>` element

### Examples to Try
1. How would we center our `<p>` without Bootstrap?
   * With Bootstrap: Just add `class="text-center"` to the element's attributes.
2. Add a button to your HTML.
   1. What happens when add `class="btn"` to our button's attributes?
   2. `class="btn btn-primary"`?
