# React
## Frameworks and Libraries
Frameworks and libraries are (pretty much) necessary for full-scale web applications.  These
frameworks and libraries make it easier for developers to create reusable web components
and use other, pre-written components.

## Getting Started with React
1. Install [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) (more specifically, only [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) is necessary but Node will be used in future sections).
2. In your command prompt or terminal, run `npm install -g create-react-app`.
3. In your projects directory, run `create-react-app new-dir-name` where *new-dir-name* is the name of the app.
4. `cd new-dir-name`
5. `npm start`

If you ran all the steps correctly, an application should be running at [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/).
