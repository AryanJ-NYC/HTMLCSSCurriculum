# Hypertext Transfer Protocol
The Hypertext Transfer Protocol, usually referred to as HTTP, allows communication between clients (your browser) and servers.
HTTP requests such as GET, POST, and DELETE requests allow clients to read, create and delete data on servers, respectively.

# HTTP Requests
An HTTP client sends an HTTP request to a server in the form of a small request message.
This request message includes information needed by the server to process the request.
This information is written in the request-line, the request headers and more.
