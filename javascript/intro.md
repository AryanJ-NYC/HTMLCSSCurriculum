Welcome to JavaScript!  ECMAScript 6, usually called ES6, was released in 2015 and has become the new standard for JavaScript.
However, ECMAScript 5, usually called ES5, is still often used (especially to ensure things run well for older browsers).
In this section, you will be introduced to JavaScript through ECMAScript 5 and then see some (not all) of the changes
made to ECMAScript 6.

As a general rule of thumb, use ECMAScript 6 whenever possible.
